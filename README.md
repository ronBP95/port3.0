## **About the Project**

<br>

There are a lot of great examples of portfolios that I have seen throughout my experiences with General Assembly, Linkedin, and Github but this is the design that I decided to go with.

<br>

Here's why:

<br>

- I was challenged
- I created something nice
- I stepped outside of my comfort zone
- I was able to take the mistakes I learned from my previous projects and use those experiences to create something that was efficient and looks great.

<br>

### **Built With**

<br>

I decided to go with building this portfolio out with <u>**HTML**</u>, <u>**CSS**</u>, and <u>**Javascript**</u> because I wanted to build out a single page application and did not anticipate any need for components which I had previously used in V1/V2 of my portfolio. I also felt that using these technologies were the easiest (for me at least) to customize without the usage of node modules, libraries or any other third party assets.

## **Roadmap**

<br>

1. Working on more javascript and react projects on the side to be displayed in the project filter section.
2. Working on making the website more responsive to smaller screens and mobile devices
3. Updating the particles.js animation. Will likely code it out by hand since the particles.js library is very taxing on CPU resources.
